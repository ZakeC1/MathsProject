# MathsProject
 The program for dataset and graph generations is in LexicalGraphAnalysis. This uses python in Google colab so that code is accessible to everyone. 
 
 All the data and graphs generated for the nine languages can be found in the Language Data folder.
 
 Finally, the written project is made using Latex and can be seen in the Math Project Latex folder.
