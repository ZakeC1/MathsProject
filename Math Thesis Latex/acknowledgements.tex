\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor Samuel Johnson for supporting me and introducing me to Graph Theory and the areas in which he has studied. For guiding me and giving his views throughout my explorations in Graph Theory. Taking the time to discuss and listen to what I've accomplished at various stages of this project and the next stages. As well as providing feedback on my findings and progress. I would also like to thank Sara Jabbari for her interest in my project and providing me with detailed feedback on what to improve.

Finally, I also thank my family and friends for supporting me and encouraging me through the project.
