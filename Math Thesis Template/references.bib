abstract = {The paper devises a new model and associated cutting-plane and branch-and-cut approaches for a variant of the undirected Chinese and rural postman problem where some of the edges offer the flexibility of either being serviced twice by two separate traversals or by a single zigzag traversal. The kernel of the proposed cutting-plane algorithm is a separation procedure for generalized blossom inequalities. We show that the currently best known separation procedure of Letchford, Reinelt and Theis [A faster exact separation algorithm for blossom inequalities. In: Nemhauser G, Bienstock D, editors, Integer programming and combinatorial optimization, vol. 3064. Berlin: Springer; 2004.

abstract = {We introduce an interesting variant of the well-known Chinese postman problem (CPP). While in the CPP the cost of traversing an edge is a constant (equal to its length), in the variant we present here the cost of traversing an edge depends on its length and on the weight of the vehicle at the moment it is traversed. This problem is inspired by the perspective of minimizing pollution in transportation, since the amount of pollution emitted by a vehicle not only depends on the travel distance but also on its load, among other factors. We define the problem, study its computational complexity, provide two mathematical programming formulations, and propose two metaheuristics for its solution. Extensive computational experiments reveal the extraordinary difficulty of this problem.},

abstract = {Graph theory has a humble beginning, as a solution to a puzzle. Residents of the Prussian city of Kongisberg, which was bisected by a river, had long pondered this puzzle. It took Leonard Euler, a mathematician, to not only solve the problem but to do so in such a novel way that his solution launched a new field of mathematics. This chapter reviews the early history of graph theory, starting with the famous story of the seven bridges of Konigsberg. It will also present other early and historically significant uses of graph theory such as Stanley Milgram’s landmark “small world problem” study. Some fundamental topics are introduced such as vertexes and edges. We close out the chapter with an exploration of the four color problem, which was explored and solved using a special type of graph called a planar graph. The four color theorem inspired a mathematician who today lends his name to a graph-inspired distance metric tracked by mathematicians, the Erdos number.}

abstract={Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators1,2,3,4, Josephson junction arrays5,6, excitable media7, neural networks8,9,10, spatial games11, genetic control networks12 and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks `rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them `small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

We provide a new local clustering coefficient for this kind of networks, starting from those already existing in the literature for the weighted and undirected case. Furthermore, we extract from our coefficient four specific components, in order to separately consider different link patterns of triangles. Empirical applications on several real networks from different frameworks and with different order are provided. The performance of our coefficient is also compared with that of existing coefficients.}
