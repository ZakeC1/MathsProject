Based upon the five of the nine total languages shown in the previous chapter. The results demonstrate the similarities of languages that are part of the same family as well as their uniqueness and the possible causes for their variety in graph property value.
\section{Final Correlations}
Based on each graph property that was studied, we take their correlations within the story corpus used and summarise.
\subsection{Local Clustering Coefficient}

\subsection{Betweenness Centrality}

\subsection{Closeness Centrality}

\subsection{Page Rank}

\subsection{Trophic Level}
